We've been working on migrating your project to use Heroicons and a custom HeroUI-style component library built with Tailwind CSS and Headless UI.

Here's a summary of our progress:

Project Setup: I initiated the new project, converting core UI components (Button, Input, Select, etc.) and updating existing pages (Header, PropertyCard, Home, DeposerUneAnnonce) to use the new HeroUI components and Heroicons.
Dependency Fixes: We addressed and resolved an issue with the tailwindcss-animate dependency.
Component-Specific Fixes:
Corrected the usage of the new Select component in app/page.tsx.
Completely refactored components/ui/select.tsx to properly integrate Headless UI and follow a compound component pattern.
Fixed icon import errors in components/PropertyCard.tsx by replacing non-existent Heroicons with appropriate alternatives.
Updated app/auth/signin/page.tsx to use Heroicons instead of Lucide icons.
